# Weekly Plans - AI Planning

## Week 1

Welcome to the AI Planning course. You will notice that all the material, including slides and videos are already available in the course Moodle area, or will be updated shortly.
Regardless of the pace in which you want to consume the course, we will use our weekly appointments to coordinate the course progress, as we would in in-person classes. Before each week, I will send out our weekly plan, indicating the materials we will work on, and when we will have a synchronous video-lecture. Such video-lecture will include problem solving and online quizzes. Below, you will can check out our weekly plan.
