11. [Reinforcement Learning](11-rl) - My original lecture
12. [Reinforcement Learning Lab](12-rl-lab) - My original lab
13. [Paper on Learning Algorithms in Planning](13-learning-planning) - Decide whether to get rid of this
14. [Assignment Proposals Presentation](14-assignment-proposals) - Move this to an earlier date
15. [Assignment Presentations](15-assignment-presentation) - 

## To Do

- [ ] Reorganize class so that assignment proposals take place earlier
- [ ] Redo slides to use the Pittsburgh style

### Classes
- [ ] 9-rl - class is too short, add other approaches to RL (SARSA, check from AI for CS)
- [ ] 10-mdp-rl lab - There is no RL in the lab, reuse assignment from undergrads
- [ ] 11 - nd-htn - There is no class for that, only the paper. Need to make one, or at least questions about the paper.

### Assignments:

- [ ] Redesign almost all assignments, but especially the assignment on MDPs
